Hello world! I work as an App Engineer at PhonePe where I develop scalable and secure apps. I received my Bachelor of Engineering at the [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://pict.edu/), which is affiliated to the University of Pune. I like building solutions using computer science which can help communities around the world. Working at PhonePe has been a life enriching experience. It's one of those places where I can dabble with Product and Project Management, Design and Business side of things.

### Updates

_I will be joining the Computer Science department at University of California, Santa Barbara in Fall 20 as a Master's student! Very excited!!_
